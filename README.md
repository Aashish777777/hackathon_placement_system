# hackathon_placement_system
Automated placement allocation system for hackathon.

This is an automated placement allocation system that assigns containers based on item IDs, making it highly useful for warehouse management. The PowerShell script fetches data from the API (http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/placement), saves it in a CSV file, and generates live tables and results. During the demonstration, I will run the script, enter '000001' as an input, and display the output 'TA01, success,' while also opening the CSV file to showcase the results. This system has the potential for future applications in real-time tracking or multi-container allocation
